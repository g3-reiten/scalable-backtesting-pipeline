## Scalable-backtesting-pipeline
Design and build a reliable, large-scale trading data pipeline so important for financial systems. 
Although the past performance of any financial market is never a reliable indicator of the future, it is important to run backtests that simulate current and past particular situations as well as their trend over time. Having a clear understanding of the financial system, stock market trading,  and recognizing the complex data engineering systems involved in the crypto and general stock market trading systems are essential.
